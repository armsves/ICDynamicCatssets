Pluto is an HTTP router implemented on the Internet Computer to facilitate working with HTTP. This router is a framework that allows you to write REST API applications on the blockchain in almost the same way as in Web 2

Pluto is an open-source project that empowers developers to build backend services on the chain. It provides a framework and tools to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) with a focus on the backend logic and functionality.
